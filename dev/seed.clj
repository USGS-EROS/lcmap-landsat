  "This will create tile-specs from real-world data that match what
   is seen production systems. The test data was created when the
   input format was not completely decided. Because this uses real
   data, it can take some time to download.

   seed/random-point and seed/contains? can be used from the repl or code to
   find a point that 'may' have data, depending on the number of scenes ingested
   via seed/tiles.  Ingest does not store tiles that are 100% fill data.")

   ;;; If the tiles are changed from path 12 row 30 below, make sure
   ;;; to update the :top :bottom :left and :right values with the proper

   ;;; metadata xml file, which can be downloaded using one of the links
   ;;; contained in the target tile .edn file.  Example values:
