(ns curate
  "Provides data curators with data management tools.

  WARNING: PLEASE READ THIS ENTIRELY BEFORE USING THESE FUNCTIONS.

  These function can be used with local and operational environments;
  but exercise caution before using this with a production system.

  Make sure you have up-to-date code and submodules. If you don't know
  exactly how to do this, talk with someone that does! Loading stale
  data in a production system could cause subtle problems.

  This namespace contains a `start` function that will limit the mount
  beings to those needed to load data. It does not start a server or
  worker, and it does not execute DB schema setup or teardown logic.

  However, you are *strongly* advised to use credentials with minimal
  permissions required to curate data (selecting and inserting data)
  so that you you don't have to worry about performing schema changes.

  You will need to create and update a copy of `dev/local.lcmap.landsat.edn`
  named `curator.edn` and place it on the resource load path. This file
  is listed in .gitignore so you don't have to worry about sensitive
  data being added to the repository."

  Because the list of sources only contains the filename and checksum,

  Provide a base-uri that does not include any path or parent directories,
  then specify a source-file that is nested in directories. The parent
  directories will be used to form a path to the source file.

  Alternatively, specify a base-url including the path to the file
  name and a path to a source file that does not have any relative parent
  directories. Although this works, it is somewhat confusing.

  "This will recursively find *all* files in a directory and produce
  an EDN file for each input file. The name of the EDN file will match
  the name of the immediate parent dir of source file. The EDN fill
  is written to a directory.

  The input directory should only contain text files with a checksum
  and source file name on each line. These files are produced separately
  with a shell script.

  Notice that the nested paths are used to build an absolute URL to
  the actual file. This is needed because the input checksum/source
  does not have an absolute path already; it must be deduced.

  The list of sources should be in directories like this:
  - sites/california/H02V09-35/sources.txt
  - sites/california/H02V09-627/sources.txt
  - sites/california/H02V09-857/sources.txt
  - ...

  The list of outputs will be:
  - data/sources/california/H02V09-35.edn
  - data/sources/california/H02V09-627.edn
  - data/sources/california/H02V09-857.edn
