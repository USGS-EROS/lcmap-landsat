# lcmap-landsat

LCMAP Landsat data retrieval and curation.

## Development

### Requirements

* Leiningen 2.7.1
* Java 1.8
* Docker 1.13.1
* Docker Compose 1.10.0

### Setup

Clone the repo.

```bash
git clone git@github.com:usgs-eros/lcmap-landsat
```

Initialize submodules (to get dev/test data).

```bash
git submodule init
git submodule update
```

Start backing services.

```bash
make docker-deps-up
```

Run the tests.

```bash
lein test
```

Start a REPL.

```bash
lein run
```

Initialize the local development schema and bindings. By default, a REPL will start the `dev/user.clj`.

```bash
(init)
```

### Sample Data

Once you have setup your environment you can load sample data. See `dev/curate.clj` to learn how to load some to use during development. This file contains code that can be evaulated in a REPL to load chip-specs and ingest chips. Because it is a powerful used for both local development and operational environments, special instructions (and warnings) are provided.

### Problems?

If you run into problem, common development and test issues are available in the [FAQ][3].

## Deployment

During routine development, use `dev/user.clj` with a REPL to run the HTTP server and AMQP workers.

### Automated Build

Travis-CI will automatically build a jarfile and Docker image after a successful build of `develop` and `master` branches. The Docker image is pushed to [Docker Hub][2].

You can build your own jarfile and Docker image using `make build` and `make docker-image`.

### Configure

Provide configuration values using environment variables when runnning the application as a jarfile or docker container.

| Environment Variable          | Default    |
|:----------------------------- | ---------- |
| AARDVARK\_BASE\_URL           | /          |
| AARDVARK\_DB\_HOST            | cassandra  |
| AARDVARK\_DB\_USER            | nil        |
| AARDVARK\_DB\_PASS            | nil        |
| AARDVARK\_EVENT\_HOST         | rabbitmq   |
| AARDVARK\_EVENT\_PORT         | 5672       |
| AARDVARK\_EVENT\_USER         | nil        |
| AARDVARK\_EVENT\_PASS         | nil        |
| AARDVARK\_HTTP\_PORT          | 5678       |
| AARDVARK\_SEARCH\_INDEX\_URL  | http://elasticsearch:9200/lcmap-landsat |
| AARDVARK\_CHIP\_SPEC\_URL     | http://elasticsearch:9200/lcmap-landsat/chip-specs |
| AARDVARK\_SERVER\_EVENTS      | lcmap.landsat.server |
| AARDVARK\_WORKER\_EVENTS      | lcmap.landsat.worker |
| AARDVARK\_LOG\LEVEL           | INFO       |

You may notice that the default hostnames are not localhost. This is because localhost is not a reasonable default for the application to use when running in the context of a Docker container; the container does not provide these services. However, service discovery systems may provide DNS support that Docker automatically can use to resolve these services. If you do not have this available, simply provide the appropriate hostname instead.

### Deployment

The Docker image can be deployed to services capable of running Docker containers (e.g. Marathon, Kubernetes). Configuration values are provided using environment variables.

Although `dev` and `test` leiningen profiles use EDN based configuration files, the values in them are *not* used in an operational environment.

## Usage

This application's primary purpose is providing Landsat raster data via HTTP. It provides three resources: chips, chip-specs, and sources.

Resources are represented as either JSON or HTML. You can use a variety of HTTP tools and libraries to retrieve data. JSON is provided by default when no Accept header is present. Set the `Accept` header to `application/json` or `text/html` for JSON and HTML respectively. Be aware that most tools automatically set this header, if you're not receiving the expected format, consult its documentation.

### Chips

Much like the way an operating system retrieves memory in pages, this application retrieves raster imagery as chips, a stack of spatially and temporally coherent data.

```bash
http http://localhost:5678/chips
                        ?x=-2013585
                        &y=3095805
                        &acquired=2000-01-01/2017-01-01
                        &ubid=LANDSAT_8/OLI_TIRS/sr_band1
                        &ubid=LANDSAT_8/OLI_TIRS/sr_band2
                        &ubid=LANDSAT_8/OLI_TIRS/sr_band3
```

### Chip-Specs

Chip-Specs describe the geometry and data-type for chips. You can get all available chip-specs...

```bash
http http://localhost:5678/chip-specs
```

...or you can get a single chip-spec...

```bash
http http://localhost:5678/chip-specs/LANDSAT_5/TM/sr_band1
```

...or you can use [ElasticSearch QueryStringSyntax][4] to get a subset of available chip-specs. By default, Elasticsearch applies the query against all indexed fields. Individual fields may also be searched directly by prepending the query with the field name plus colon. For example, `?q=ubid:landsat_7 AND etm AND sr_band1`

*Please note: UBIDs contain a forward-slash "/" and cannot be supplied as a ?q parameter; Elasticsearch syntax interprets this character as a regular expression, so they must be escaped.*

```bash
http http://localhost:5678/chip-specs?q=((landsat AND 8) AND NOT sr AND (band1 OR band2 OR band3))
```

### Sources

Sources provide information about where information was obtained. Each chip has a `source-id` that can be used to determine what file was ingested and which bands were chipped. A random sample of ten sources can be retrieved like this:

```bash
http http://localhost:5678/sources
```

A specific source can be retrieved like this:

```bash
http http://localhost:5678/source/LT050460261984185-SC20161231013600
