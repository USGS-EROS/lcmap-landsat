# This file exists to make it easy for you to run the project as
# a Docker container during local development. You can use this
# to evaulate configuration related changes that are difficult to
# test using automated tests.
#
# This configuration uses the hostnames Docker assigns to services
# described in the resource/docker-compose.yml file. In order for
# the container to access these services, you will need to run it
# in the same network as them.
