# This file exists to make it easy for you to run an uberjar to
# evaluate how the application operates in standalone mode. During
# active development a REPL is strongly recommended.
#
# In order for the application to connect to backing services, you
# will need to run docker-compose; see Makefile for details. Unlike
# the docker-run script, this can refer to services using localhost
# because services are port-mapped.
