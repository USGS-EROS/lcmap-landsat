(ns lcmap.aardvark.core
  "Functions for starting a server, worker, or both.

  The server is an HTTP handler and the worker is an AMQP consumer.

  Both modes of operation can be run in a single process, although
  in a production environment they should be run separately so that
  each can be scaled independently to handle varying workloads.

  * `dev/lcmap/aardvark/dev.clj` for REPL-driven development.
  * `dev/resources/lcmap-landsat.edn` for configuration."
